# tic-tac-toe

This project was didn't take me too long to complete. Focused on organizing my code a bit better and avoiding any global code. I think I did a pretty good job.
The logic wasn't too terrible to figure out. I'm sure there is a better solution than what I figured out, but it works.

Feel free to try it out. 

The X Player always goes first on the very first game. Starting player alternates from there.
